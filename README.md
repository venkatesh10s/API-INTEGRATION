This project is the first task of my internship, and the main goal was to build a basic project using an external API. I chose to work with the OpenWeatherMap API, which provides real-time weather data for any city in the world.
I created a simple weather app that allows the user to enter the name of a city and then see the current weather conditions of that city. I have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build this project. I did everything using basic frontend technologies, without any frameworks. I wrote the code myself and made sure the output is working clearly and correctly.

## What This Project Does

The app takes a city name from the user and then uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data. After getting the response from the API, the app shows:

Temperature (in Celsius)

Weather condition (like cloudy, clear, rain, etc.)

Humidity level

Wind speed

If the user enters a wrong city or leaves it blank, I added a message that shows an error, so it doesn’t crash or confuse the user.

## How I Built It

I used Visual Studio Code as my editor and wrote all the code myself.

1. First, I designed a simple HTML layout with an input box and a button.

2. I used JavaScript’s fetch() function to call the API when the button is clicked.

3. The API returns a JSON response, and I extracted the required data from it.

4. I displayed that data on the webpage using JavaScript DOM manipulation.

5. I added some CSS styles to make it look neat and simple.

I also made sure that the app doesn’t break if the city name is wrong or if there’s a network error. I handled those situations using try...catch and if conditions in JavaScript.

## Why I Chose This Project

I selected this weather API because it’s very common and useful in real-world applications. Many websites and apps use weather data to help users plan their day or travel. I also wanted to get some hands-on practice with calling external APIs and handling responses using JavaScript. This task gave me a good chance to do that.

## Where This Can Be Used

This type of project is useful in many situations. It can be used as a widget in a dashboard, or part of a travel website, or even in personal productivity apps. Weather is something users check daily, so this kind of integration is always valuable.

## What I Learned

Through this task, I improved my skills in:

API integration using fetch()

JSON data handling

DOM manipulation

Writing clean and working JavaScript code

Error handling and input validation

Most importantly, I now understand how frontend apps connect to real-time data and show it to the user dynamically.

## Final Output

The final output is a working weather web app that fetches and displays the current weather for any city the user enters. I tested it with multiple cities like "London", "New York", "Chennai", and it displayed the data properly.
This was a great first task that helped me get confident in working with live APIs and building frontend projects that fetch and show dynamic data.
